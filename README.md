# Dotfiles

I update my dotfiles A LOT. Taking care of the README would be too time
consuming and possibly counter-productive. If you're interested, just browse
around. The best I can offer are my configs for `vim`/`nvim`, `bash`/`zsh`,
`tmux` and Visual Studio Code. There's also some comfy install scripts.

# Dotfiles

I update my dotfiles A LOT. Taking care of the README would be too time
consuming and possibly counter-productive. If you're interested, just browse
around. The best I can offer are my configs for `vim`, `bash`/`zsh`,
`tmux` and Visual Studio Code. There's also some comfy install scripts.

My `nvim` config is moved to [`kosma-hyzoe/nvim-sane`](https://github.com/kosma-hyzoe/nvim-sane).
